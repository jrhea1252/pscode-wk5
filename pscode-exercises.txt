// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

WriteLine ("Enter number 1:")
int a = ReadLine();
WriteLine ("Enter number 2:")
int b = ReadLine();
WriteLine ("Enter number 3:")
int c = ReadLine();
WriteLine ("Enter number 4:")
int d = ReadLine();
WriteLine ("Enter number 5:")
int e = ReadLine();

int sum = a + b + c + d + e
int average = sum / 5
int smallest = (a < b && a < c && a < d && a < e) ? a : (( b < c && b < d && b < e) ? b: ( c < d && c < e) ? c : (d < e ? d : e ));
int largest = (a > b && a > c && a > d && a > e) ? a : (( b > c && b > d && b > e) ? b: ( c > d && c > e) ? c : (d > e ? d : e ));

WriteLine("The average of your five numbers is: {average}. The smallest of your five numbers is: {smallest}. The largest of your fiver numbers is: {largest}.");
